        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>At Digital Nipuna, we are committed to providing high-quality website design, development, and digital marketing services. This Cancellation and Refund Policy outlines the process and terms under which clients may request a cancellation or refund for services provided by Digital Nipuna.</p>

        <h2>2. Cancellation of Services</h2>
        <p>If you wish to cancel the services provided by Digital Nipuna, you must notify us in writing via email at <strong>info@digitalnipuna.com</strong>. The following terms apply to cancellations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Website Design & Development:</strong> If the project is in the early stages (i.e., before any work has been started or the initial design is presented), you may cancel the project with no charges beyond any administrative fees.</li>
            <li><strong>Ongoing Services:</strong> For ongoing digital marketing services, a 30-day notice period is required for cancellation. If services are canceled within 30 days of a billing cycle, you will be responsible for paying for the services rendered during that period.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Development Projects:</strong> If a project is in progress, cancellation may result in charges for the work already completed up to the point of cancellation. This will be calculated based on an hourly rate or milestone payments, as agreed in the contract.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>Refunds will be processed based on the terms of the specific services provided. The following conditions apply to refunds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Design and Development Projects:</strong> Once work has commenced on a design or development project, refunds are not available for any work already completed. However, if the project is canceled before any work is started, a full refund of any upfront payment will be provided.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Marketing Services:</strong> For digital marketing services, if you are dissatisfied with the services provided, you may request a refund within the first 7 days of service. After 7 days, no refunds will be provided. The refund will be prorated based on the number of days services were provided before cancellation.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Services:</strong> If you have subscribed to a recurring service and decide to cancel, you will not be refunded for the current billing cycle, but your subscription will be canceled for subsequent cycles.</li>
        </ul>
