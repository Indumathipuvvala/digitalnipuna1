        <p>Digital Nipuna - Website Design, Development & Digital Marketing</p>
    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>At Digital Nipuna, we offer high-quality website design, development, and digital marketing services to our clients. As a digital services provider, our shipping and delivery refer to the delivery of digital products, services, and results. This policy outlines the process for service delivery, timelines, and expectations for our clients.</p>

        <h2>2. Service Delivery</h2>
        <p>Our services are delivered through digital means. We do not provide physical shipping of products. The following applies to our service delivery:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Website Design and Development:</strong> Once the design and development work has been completed and approved by the client, the website will be delivered to the clientâ€™s domain and hosting provider. The final files, including all design and development files, will be transferred upon completion of the project.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Marketing Campaigns:</strong> After the digital marketing strategy and campaigns are set, we will begin delivering results through various online channels. Clients will receive regular reports and updates regarding campaign performance via email or through a shared project management platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Ongoing Maintenance:</strong> For clients with ongoing website maintenance and digital marketing packages, regular updates and changes will be delivered according to the agreed-upon schedule. This may include monthly performance reports, content updates, or SEO improvements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Delivery Timeframes</h2>
        <p>The following general timelines apply to our services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Website Design & Development:</strong> Depending on the complexity of the project, website design and development typically takes between 2 to 8 weeks from the initial agreement and the provision of necessary content. A more accurate timeline will be provided in the project agreement after assessing the project requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Marketing Services:</strong> For ongoing digital marketing services, delivery times vary depending on the service being provided (e.g., SEO, social media marketing, PPC campaigns). Marketing campaigns may take several weeks to show measurable results. We provide regular progress reports to keep clients updated.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Creation:</strong> Content creation (such as blog posts, video production, or graphics) generally takes 1-2 weeks, depending on the scope of the project.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Delays in Delivery</h2>
        <p>While we strive to meet all delivery timelines, there may be delays caused by factors outside our control, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client delays in providing necessary materials, information, or approvals</li>
            <li>Technical issues with third-party tools or platforms</li>
            <li>Unexpected changes in project scope or requirements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If there is a delay in the delivery of services, we will notify the client promptly and provide an updated timeline. We aim to keep all projects on schedule, but please be aware that some factors may result in unavoidable delays.</p>

        <h2>5. Delivery Confirmation</h2>
        <p>Upon completion of services (website launch, marketing campaign setup, etc.), we will provide a final confirmation to the client. This may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Confirmation of the website launch with access credentials</li>
            <li>Access to marketing campaign dashboards or reports</li>
            <li>Delivery of all digital assets created as part of the project (e.g., website files, graphics, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Client Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>For smooth service delivery, clients are expected to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide timely feedback and approvals for work completed, especially for website design and development projects.</li>
            <li>Ensure that all required content (such as logos, images, and text) is provided in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Provide necessary access to hosting accounts, social media accounts, or other platforms required for service delivery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Service Modifications and Updates</h2>
        <p>If you wish to make any changes or updates after the completion of the project, you may request modifications. Additional work may be subject to extra charges, depending on the scope of the modifications requested.</p>
